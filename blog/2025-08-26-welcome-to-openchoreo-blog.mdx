Welcome to the OpenChoreo Blog, your new home for updates, ideas, and stories from the OpenChoreo open-source community! We’re just getting started, and we’re thrilled to share this journey with you.

On this blog, we plan to post release updates, upcoming features, community adoption stories, and the occasional off-topic stuff (you’ve been warned).

In the meantime, we’d love to hear your thoughts on the OpenChoreo logo. What comes to your mind when you see it? Feel free to share your impressions, interpretations, or wild guesses in whatever way you can. We’ll write more about the logo soon.

To wrap things up, here’s a roundup of recent posts, talks, and videos that dive deeper into OpenChoreo or explore related ideas in the platform engineering space:
