# Deploy Your First Component

This guide walks you through deploying your first component on OpenChoreo. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a running web service accessible through the platform, complete with monitoring and security configured automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **OpenChoreo installed** in your Kubernetes cluster (see [Run Locally](./try-it-out/on-k3d-locally.mdx) or the [Operations Guide](../operations/deployment-topology.mdx) for production setup)
- **kubectl** configured to access your cluster
- **kubectl context** set to your cluster (should be `k3d-openchoreo` if following the k3d setup)

## Step 1: Verify Your Setup

First, make sure you have set up OpenChoreo on your cluster following one of the installation guides.

You should see all OpenChoreo components running with the control plane and data plane pods in `Running` status.

## Step 2: Deploy the Go Greeter Service

For this tutorial, we'll use the Go Greeter Service sample that comes with OpenChoreo. This is a simple web service that demonstrates OpenChoreo's core capabilities.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/${versions.githubRef}/samples/from-image/go-greeter-service/greeter-service.yaml`}
</CodeBlock>

This single command creates:
- **Component**: Defines the application and its requirements (references the `deployment/service` ComponentType)
- **Workload**: Specifies the container image and runtime configuration
- **ReleaseBinding**: Deploys the component to the development environment
- **SecretReference**: Manages external secrets for the component

## Step 3: Monitor the Deployment

Check that all resources are created:

```bash
kubectl get component,workload,releasebinding -A
```

Check the component status:

```bash
kubectl get component greeter-service
```

Monitor the component deployment:

```bash
kubectl get releasebinding greeter-service-development
```

## Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Wait for the service to be ready (this may take 1-2 minutes).

Check the actual Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -A | grep greeter
```

Verify pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep greeter
```

Check HTTP routes are configured:

```bash
kubectl get httproute -A -o wide
```

## Step 5: Test Your Application

Test the greeter service endpoint:

```bash
curl http://development-default.openchoreoapis.localhost:19080/greeter-service/greeter/greet
```

You should receive a successful response:
```text
Hello, Stranger!
```

You can also test with a name parameter:
```bash
curl http://development-default.openchoreoapis.localhost:19080/greeter-service/greeter/greet?name=OpenChoreo
```

Expected output:
```text
Hello, OpenChoreo!
```

This confirms that:
- Your component is deployed and running
- The API gateway is properly configured
- Network routing is working correctly
- Security policies are applied automatically

## Step 6: Explore What OpenChoreo Created

Let's examine what OpenChoreo automatically created for your component.

View the OpenChoreo resources:

```bash
kubectl get component,workload,releasebinding -n default
```

Check the underlying Kubernetes resources:

```bash
kubectl get deployment,pod,svc -A | grep greeter
```

View the HTTP routing configuration:

```bash
kubectl describe httproute -A | grep -A 20 greeter
```

OpenChoreo automatically created:
- **Component** - High-level application definition (using the `deployment/service` ComponentType)
- **Workload** - Container deployment specification
- **ReleaseBinding** - Environment-specific deployment configuration
- **Deployment** - Kubernetes deployment managing pods
- **Service** - Kubernetes service for networking
- **HTTPRoute** - Gateway API routing configuration
- **Secret** - External secrets synchronized from the secret store

## Summary

You've successfully:
- Deployed your first OpenChoreo component from a container image
- Tested API access through the OpenChoreo gateway
- Explored the resources OpenChoreo created automatically

Your application is now running in a production-ready environment with enterprise-grade security, networking, and observability—all configured automatically by OpenChoreo!

## Clean Up

To remove the sample application:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/${versions.githubRef}/samples/from-image/go-greeter-service/greeter-service.yaml`}
</CodeBlock>
