# Learn from Examples

OpenChoreo empowers developers to build cloud-native applications through practical, real-world examples. This section provides comprehensive tutorials that demonstrate OpenChoreo's capabilities across different use cases and complexity levels.

## Categories
We have categorized the samples based on what you might want to do: 
- **[Platform Configuration](#platform-configuration)** - Define and customize foundational platform elements such as organizations, environments, and deployment pipelines according to your organization needs.
- **[Application Deployment](#application-deployment)** - Deploy different types of applications (services, APIs, web apps, tasks) using various programming languages and deployment strategies.

---

## Platform Configuration
When you set up OpenChoreo, certain default resources are automatically created to help you get started quickly:
- A default organization
- A default data plane and build plane
- Three default environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- A default deployment pipeline connecting these environments
- A default project to organize applications

OpenChoreo provides abstractions to define:
- **Organizations** – Manage access and group related projects at cluster scope.
- **Environments** – Set up Dev, Staging, and Prod runtime contexts.
- **DataPlanes** – Define Kubernetes clusters for application deployments.
- **BuildPlanes** – Define dedicated Kubernetes clusters for CI operations.
- **DeploymentPipelines** – Automate application rollouts with promotion workflows.

For more details on these concepts, refer to the [Concepts](../concepts/platform-abstractions.md) documentation.

These default configurations provide a quick starting point. Once you have done some exploration you can start creating the necessary artifacts to match the needs of your organization. You can:

- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-environments">Create new environments</GitHubSampleLink> in your organization
- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-deployment-pipeline">Create a new deployment pipeline</GitHubSampleLink> that will link these environments

## Application Deployment
OpenChoreo uses a flexible ComponentType architecture where platform engineers define templates and developers create components from these templates.

### Understanding ComponentTypes

OpenChoreo provides a **ComponentType** abstraction that allows platform engineers to define reusable application templates with:
- Workload types (Deployment, StatefulSet, CronJob, Job, Proxy)
- Configurable parameters and environment overrides
- Kubernetes resource templates with CEL expressions

Developers create **Component** resources that reference these ComponentTypes, providing a clean separation between platform governance and developer intent.

### Default ComponentTypes

OpenChoreo ships with three default ComponentTypes out of the box:

- **`deployment/service`** – Backend services and APIs
  - Configurable replicas, port, resources, and image pull policy
  - Includes Deployment, Service, and optional HTTPRoute resources
  - Supports environment-specific overrides

- **`deployment/web-application`** – Frontend or full-stack web applications
  - Always exposed via HTTPRoute with dedicated subdomain
  - Configurable replicas, port, resources, and image pull policy

- **`cronjob/scheduled-task`** – Time-based batch jobs and background tasks
  - Configurable cron schedule, concurrency policy, and resource limits
  - Environment-specific schedules for different deployment stages

### ComponentType Examples

Learn how to work with ComponentTypes and create custom component definitions:

- **<GitHubSampleLink path="component-types/component-http-service">HTTP Service Component</GitHubSampleLink>** – Custom ComponentType for HTTP services with routing
- **<GitHubSampleLink path="component-types/component-web-app">Web Application Component</GitHubSampleLink>** – ComponentType optimized for web applications
- **<GitHubSampleLink path="component-types/component-with-configs">Component with Configurations</GitHubSampleLink>** – Managing Configs and Secrets with components
- **<GitHubSampleLink path="component-types/component-with-traits">Component with Traits</GitHubSampleLink>** – Composing reusable traits into components

### Application Examples by Source Type
