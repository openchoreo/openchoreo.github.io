# Learn from Examples

OpenChoreo empowers developers to build cloud-native applications through practical, real-world examples. This section provides comprehensive tutorials that demonstrate OpenChoreo's capabilities across different use cases and complexity levels.

## Categories
We have categorized the samples based on what you might want to do: 
- **[Platform Configuration](#platform-configuration)** - Define and customize foundational platform elements such as organizations, environments, and deployment pipelines according to your organization needs.
- **[Application Deployment](#application-deployment)** - Deploy different types of applications (services, APIs, web apps, tasks) using various programming languages and deployment strategies.

---

## Platform Configuration
When you set up OpenChoreo, certain default resources are automatically created to help you get started quickly:
- A default organization
- A default data plane and build plane
- Three default environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- A default deployment pipeline connecting these environments
- A default project to organize applications

OpenChoreo provides abstractions to define:
- **Organizations** – Manage access and group related projects at cluster scope.
- **Environments** – Set up Dev, Staging, and Prod runtime contexts.
- **DataPlanes** – Define Kubernetes clusters for application deployments.
- **BuildPlanes** – Define dedicated Kubernetes clusters for CI/CD operations.
- **DeploymentPipelines** – Automate application rollouts with promotion workflows.

For more details on these concepts, refer to the [Concepts](../concepts/platform-abstractions.md) documentation.

These default configurations provide a quick starting point. Once you have done some exploration you can start creating the necessary artifacts to match the needs of your organization. You can:

- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-environments">Create new environments</GitHubSampleLink> in your organization
- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-deployment-pipeline">Create a new deployment pipeline</GitHubSampleLink> that will link these environments

---

## Application Deployment
These samples help you deploy different types of applications using OpenChoreo. All samples refer to the default setup.

### Component Types

OpenChoreo supports different component types with the modern **Component** resource:

- **<GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/services">Services</GitHubSampleLink>** – Backend services & APIs built from source code

### Complete Application Examples

- **<GitHubSampleLink path="gcp-microservices-demo/">GCP Microservices Demo</GitHubSampleLink>** – Complete multi-service application demonstrating:
  - Project organization with multiple components
  - Service interactions and dependencies
  - Coordinated deployment patterns
  - Configuration management across services

### Supported Languages (via BuildPacks)
OpenChoreo abstracts the build and deployment process using BuildPacks and Build resources, enabling developers to deploy applications written in:
- **Ballerina** - <GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/services/ballerina-buildpack-patient-management/">Patient Management Service</GitHubSampleLink>
- **Go** - <GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/services/go-docker-greeter/">Greeter Service</GitHubSampleLink> and <GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/services/go-google-buildpack-reading-list/">Reading List</GitHubSampleLink>
- **Node.js/React** - <GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/web-apps/react-starter/">React Starter</GitHubSampleLink>
- **Python** - (Additional samples can be added)
- **Ruby** - (Additional samples can be added)
- (More languages can be added as extensions.)

### Key Features Demonstrated

- **<GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/">Build Integration</GitHubSampleLink>** – Component with integrated Build for CI/CD workflows
- **<GitHubSampleLink path="from-image/issue-reporter-schedule-task/">Configuration Management</GitHubSampleLink>** – Environment-specific configs and secrets
- **<GitHubSampleLink path="from-source/services/">Component Types</GitHubSampleLink>** – Component types with environment-specific ComponentDeployments

### Getting Started

1. **Deploy Platform Configuration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f platform-config/new-environments/
   kubectl apply -f platform-config/new-deployment-pipeline/
   ```

2. **Deploy a Simple Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f from-source/services/go-docker-greeter/
   ```

3. **Deploy Complete Application**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f gcp-microservices-demo/
   ```

> [!Note] 
> In case you need to try these application samples with custom platform configuration, remember to use the new resource names you created while following the "Platform Configuration" section above.
