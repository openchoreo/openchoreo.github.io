# Navigating OpenChoreo

OpenChoreo serves two primary personas, each with distinct responsibilities and workflows. **Platform Engineers** focus on setting up and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, security policies, and developer experience standards that enable self-service capabilities. They establish organizational boundaries, configure multi-cluster deployments, define golden path templates, and ensure compliance and operational excellence across the platform.

**Developers** interact with OpenChoreo's high-level abstractions to build, deploy, and operate applications without needing deep infrastructure knowledge. They create projects and components, configure service dependencies, manage application lifecycles, and leverage the platform's automated build, deployment, and observability capabilities to focus on delivering business value.

These complementary roles work together to create an Internal Developer Platform that balances developer productivity with operational control, security, and scalability.

## How Platform Engineers Set Up the Platform

Platform engineers are responsible for establishing the foundational infrastructure and policies that enable developer self-service:

### Infrastructure Setup
- **Install OpenChoreo Control Plane**: Deploy the core platform components using Helm charts
- **Configure Data Planes, Build Planes and Observability Plane**: Set up Kubernetes clusters with Cilium networking and required operators and tools using Helm charts
- **Establish Environments**: Define development, staging, and production environments with appropriate policies

### Platform Configuration
- **Organization Structure**: Create organizations and define access policies for different teams
- **Security Policies**: Configure Cilium network policies, mTLS certificates, and RBAC rules
- **Observability Stack**: Set up monitoring, logging, and tracing infrastructure (Prometheus and OpenSearch)
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Configure Argo Workflows for automated build and deployment processes

### Golden Path Definition
- **Component Templates**: Create standardized templates for common application patterns
- **Deployment Policies**: Define promotion workflows
- **Resource Quotas**: Set limits and constraints for different environments and teams

## How Developers Add Applications

Developers interact with OpenChoreo through high-level abstractions that hide infrastructure complexity:

### Project Creation
- **Initialize Project**: Create a new project representing a bounded context or business domain
- **Define Components**: Specify services, workers, or scheduled tasks within the project
- **Configure Endpoints**: Set up API endpoints with appropriate visibility scopes

### Application Development
- **Source Integration**: Connect Git repositories to trigger automated builds
- **Local Development**: Use OpenChoreo CLI tools for local testing and debugging
- **Dependency Management**: Declare connections to other services or external resources

### Deployment Process
- **Commit and Push**: Connect application code into components
- **Build and Deploy**: Automatic build and deployment based on template definitions
- **Environment promotion**: Applications move through environments based on defined workflows
- **Monitoring Access**: Built-in observability provides insights into application performance

### Self-Service Operations
- **Configuration Management**: Update environment variables and secrets through the platform
- **Scaling**: Adjust resource allocation and replica counts as needed in templates
- **Troubleshooting**: Access logs, metrics, and traces through unified interfaces

The detailed workflows below explain how platform engineers and developers can accomplish these tasks using OpenChoreo's abstractions and tools.
