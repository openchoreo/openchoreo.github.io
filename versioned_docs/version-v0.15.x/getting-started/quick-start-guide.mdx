# Quick Start Guide

Follow this guide to quickly set up OpenChoreo in a local environment with Docker.

The setup uses a preconfigured Dev Container that includes all required dependencies for installation and cleanup.

    Ensure the following before you begin:

    - **Docker** (Engine [26.0+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.0/) recommended)
    - Allocate at least **4 GB RAM** and **2 CPUs**.
    - If you plan to install with BuildPlane, allocate **8 GB RAM** and **4 CPUs** for optimal performance.
    - **5-10** minutes of setup time

    :::note
    If you encounter issues with Docker alternatives (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, etc.), report them via
    [GitHub](https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/issues).
    :::

    :::tip Mac Users
    For optimal compatibility and to avoid buildpack build issues, we recommend using [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) with VZ and Rosetta support:

    ```bash
    colima start --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta --cpu 4 --memory 8
    ```

    <div className="step-header">
        <div className="step-header-icon">1</div>
        <div className="step-header-text"> Start the Dev Container</div>
    </div>
    Run the following command to start the dev container and open a terminal session within it:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {String.raw`docker run --rm -it --name openchoreo-quick-start \
    --pull always \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --network=host \
    ghcr.io/openchoreo/quick-start:`}{versions.dockerTag}
    </CodeBlock>
</div>

<div className="step-card">
    <div className="step-header">
        <div className="step-header-icon">2</div>
        <div className="step-header-text">Install OpenChoreo</div>
    </div>

    Inside the container, run the installation command:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {`./install.sh --version ${versions.dockerTag}`}
    </CodeBlock>

    This command performs the following:

    - Creates a local [k3d](https://k3d.io/) (k3s-in-Docker) cluster
    - Installs OpenChoreo and its dependencies using Helm charts

    :::tip
    The installation script is idempotent. You can rerun it safely if the process is interrupted.
    :::

    When installation completes successfully, you see a summary of component statuses:

    <img
        src={require('./qsg-install-status-success.png').default}
        alt="Installation Success Screenshot"
        width="80%"
    />

    :::tip
    If any components remain in the `pending` state, wait a few minutes and run the following command to check their
    status:

    ```bash
    ./check-status.sh
    ```

        <div className="step-header-icon">3</div>
        <div className="step-header-text">Deploy a Sample Web Application</div>
    </div>

    After setting up OpenChoreo in your Docker environment, deploy a sample web application by running:

    ```bash
    ./deploy-react-starter.sh
    ```

    When deployment completes, the output includes a message with the application URL:

    ```text
    [SUCCESS] React Starter web application is ready!
    🌍 Access the application at: http://react-starter-development-default.openchoreoapis.localhost:19080
    Open this URL in your browser to see the React starter application.

    [INFO] To clean up and delete this application, run:
    [INFO] ./deploy-react-starter.sh --clean
    ```
</div>

        <div className="step-header-icon">4</div>
        <div className="step-header-text">Access the Backstage UI</div>
    </div>

    Now that your web application is deployed, access the OpenChoreo Backstage UI to explore and manage your components:

    Access the UI at: http://openchoreo.localhost:8080/

    Default login credentials:
    - Username: <code>{defaultCredentials.username}</code>
    - Password: <code>{defaultCredentials.password}</code>

    <img 
        src={require('./qsg-backstage-ui.png').default}
        alt="Backstage UI Screenshot"
        width="80%"
    />


    Take some time to explore the interface where you can:
    - View your deployed components
    - Monitor application status
    - Access component catalogs
    - Manage deployment pipelines

    :::note
    To access advanced features like **CI/CD pipelines** (Build Plane) and **Observability** (Observability Plane) within the UI, you can enable them by including the following flags during installation:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {`./install.sh --version ${versions.dockerTag} --with-build --with-observability`}
    </CodeBlock>

    ### Understanding the Setup

    Running the installation and deployment commands initializes OpenChoreo locally and deploys a sample web
    application.
    The following sections describe what occurs behind the scenes.

    #### 1. The Install Command

    The installation process:

    - Initializes a Dev Container with all required tools.
    - Creates a k3d (k3s-in-Docker) cluster in Docker.
    - Installs the OpenChoreo IDP and dependencies using Helm charts.

    #### Foundation Resources Created

    The installation automatically provisions the following OpenChoreo abstractions:

    - Namespace (Kubernetes namespace labeled with `openchoreo.dev/controlplane-namespace: true`)
    - Data Plane
    - Build Plane
    - Environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production)
    - [Deployment Pipeline](../reference/api/platform/deployment-pipeline.md)
    - Project
    - Component Types (e.g., service, web-application, scheduled-task)

    View these resources using the following commands:

    ```bash
    kubectl get namespaces -l openchoreo.dev/controlplane-namespace=true
    kubectl get dataplanes
    kubectl get environments
    kubectl get projects
    kubectl get componenttypes
    ```

    View details for a specific resource:

    ```bash
    kubectl get project default -oyaml
    ```

    #### 2. Deploy Command

    The deployment script creates:

    - A sample Web Application Component
    - The corresponding Deployment resource

    List deployed components:

    ```bash
    kubectl get components
    ```

    #### 3. UI Architecture

    The Backstage UI is powered by the OpenChoreo Backstage plugin, providing a unified interface for managing your components and deployments. The authentication and user management is handled by Asgardio, a lightweight identity management platform that secures access to your OpenChoreo environment.

    :::tip
    Explore more examples in the <Link
    to={`https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/tree/${versions.githubRef}/samples`}>Samples</Link> directory or in
    `/samples` inside the Dev Container.
    :::

    :::important
    When running samples in the Dev Container, you don't need to expose the OpenChoreo Gateway manually; it's already
    available on port 19080 (HTTP) and port 19443 (HTTPS) of the host machine.

    ## Explore More

    After deploying your first application, try these additional examples to explore more of OpenChoreo's capabilities:

    ### GCP Microservices Demo

    Deploy a complete microservices application with 11 services (frontend, cart, checkout, payment, etc.):

    ```bash
    ./deploy-gcp-demo.sh
    ```

    This demonstrates how OpenChoreo handles multi-service applications and service-to-service communication.

    ### Build and Deploy from Source

    Experience the full development workflow by building a container image from source code and deploying it:

    ```bash
    ./build-deploy-greeter.sh
    ```

    :::note
    This example requires the Build Plane. If you didn't install it initially, reinstall with:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">
        {`./install.sh --version ${versions.dockerTag} --with-build`}
    </CodeBlock>
    :::

    This demonstrates:
    - Building container images from source
    - Storing images in the integrated container registry
    - Deploying the built image to the Data Plane

        <div className="step-header-icon">5</div>
        <div className="step-header-text">Cleaning up</div>
    </div>

    After completing your work, choose one of the following options:

    1. **Exit and return later**: Exit the Dev Container to resume work later:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
    2. **Full cleanup**: Remove all resources and restore a clean environment:
    ```bash
    ./uninstall.sh
    exit
    ```

    This completes the setup and teardown process for OpenChoreo.

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Docker Resource Constraints

    If installation fails, confirm Docker has sufficient resources:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm alpine:latest sh -c "echo 'Memory:'; free -h; echo; echo 'CPU Cores:'; nproc"
    ```

    Ensure at least **4 GB RAM** and **2 CPU cores** are allocated (or **8 GB RAM** and **4 CPU cores** if using
    BuildPlane).

</div>

You have now set up OpenChoreo locally using a preconfigured environment, deployed a sample web application, and learned how to inspect, manage, and clean up the setup.
This environment serves as a reproducible baseline for testing and evaluating OpenChoreo components and workflows.
