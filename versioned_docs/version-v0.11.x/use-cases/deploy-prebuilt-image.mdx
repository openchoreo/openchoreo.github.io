# Deploy a Prebuilt Container Image

This guide walks you through deploying a prebuilt container image to OpenChoreo. This is useful when you have existing container images built by external CI/CD pipelines and want to deploy them without using OpenChoreo's Build Plane.

## Overview

OpenChoreo supports deploying applications from prebuilt container images, commonly referred to as "Bring Your Own Image" (BYOI).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **OpenChoreo installed** in your Kubernetes cluster
- **kubectl** configured to access your cluster
- **A container image** to deploy

## Deploy an Image

Deploying an image is straightforward - simply create the Component and Workload resources.

### Example

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  autoDeploy: true
  componentType: deployment/service
  owner:
    projectName: default
  parameters:
    exposed: true
    port: 80
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 256Mi
---
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: my-app-workload
  namespace: default
spec:
  owner:
    componentName: my-app
    projectName: default
  containers:
    main:
      image: "nginx:latest"
EOF
```

Replace the following values with your own:
- `nginx:latest` - Your image reference
- `80` - The port your application listens on
- Add environment variables as needed by your application

### Verify the Deployment

Check that the component is created:

```bash
kubectl get component my-app
```

Check that the workload is created:

```bash
kubectl get workload my-app-workload
```

Check that pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep my-app
```

### Test Your Application

Once the deployment is ready, test your application:

```bash
curl http://development.openchoreoapis.localhost:19080/my-app/
```
