# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is OpenChoreo?
OpenChoreo is an open-source Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that simplifies cloud-native application development by providing developer-friendly abstractions over complex Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.

### How is OpenChoreo different from other platforms?
OpenChoreo focuses on:
- **Developer Experience**: Simple abstractions without losing Kubernetes power
- **Security by Default**: Built-in security with cell-based architecture
- **CNCF Integration**: Orchestrates best-in-class cloud-native tools
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development with no vendor lock-in

### What are the main benefits of using OpenChoreo?
- **Faster Time to Market**: Deploy applications in minutes instead of days
- **Reduced Complexity**: Focus on business logic instead of infrastructure
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade capabilities from day one
- **Consistent Environments**: Identical configurations across all stages

## Architecture & Concepts

### What is a "Cell" in OpenChoreo?
A Cell is OpenChoreo's security boundary that:
- Isolates applications using Kubernetes namespaces
- Enforces network policies with Cilium
- Provides encrypted communication with mTLS
- Implements identity-based access controls
- Usually this is a Project in OpenChoreo

### How does OpenChoreo handle multi-environment deployments?
OpenChoreo uses Environment abstractions that:
- Define deployment targets (dev, staging, prod)
- Apply environment-specific configurations
- Enforce resource quotas and policies
- Enable promotion workflows between environments

### What's the difference between a Project and a Component?
- **Project**: A logical grouping of related components (e.g., an e-commerce platform)
- **Component**: An individual deployable unit (e.g., user-service, payment-api)

### How does OpenChoreo integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?
OpenChoreo provides:
- **CLI tools** for integration with any CI system
- **GitHub Actions** for seamless GitHub workflows
- **Webhooks** for custom integrations
- **API endpoints** for programmatic access

## Performance & Deployment

### What are the resource requirements for OpenChoreo?
**Control Plane (minimum)**:
- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended with observability plane)
- **Storage**: 20 GB

### Can OpenChoreo work with multiple clusters?
Yes, you can setup the following patterns
- **All in one cluster**: Where all the planes are in a single cluster
- **Combined clusters**: Where a combination of planes are together spread across multiple clusters 
   e.g. control plane separate and others together, observability plane separate and others together
- **Totally seperated clusters**: Where each plane has it's own cluster. Note that this is not usually for a local setup.
