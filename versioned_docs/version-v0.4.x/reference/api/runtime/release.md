# Release

A Release represents the actual deployment of application resources to a data plane environment in OpenChoreo. It is
created by binding resources (ServiceBinding, WebApplicationBinding, ScheduledTaskBinding) and contains the complete
set of Kubernetes resources that need to be applied to the target environment. Releases manage the lifecycle and health
monitoring of deployed resources.

## API Version

`openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1`

## Resource Definition

### Metadata

Releases are namespace-scoped resources that must be created within an Organization's namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: openchoreo.dev/v1alpha1

  namespace: <org-namespace>  # Organization namespace
```
