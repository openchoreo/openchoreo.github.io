# Learn from Examples

OpenChoreo empowers developers to build cloud-native applications through practical, real-world examples. This section provides comprehensive tutorials that demonstrate OpenChoreo's capabilities across different use cases and complexity levels.

## Categories
We have categorized the samples based on what you might want to do: 
- **[Platform Configuration](#platform-configuration)** - Define and customize foundational platform elements such as organizations, environments, and deployment pipelines according to your organization needs.
- **[Application Deployment](#application-deployment)** - Deploy different types of applications (services, APIs, web apps, tasks) using various programming languages and deployment strategies.

---

## Platform Configuration
When you set up OpenChoreo, certain default resources are automatically created to help you get started quickly:
- A default organization
- A default data plane and build plane
- Three default environments (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- A default deployment pipeline connecting these environments
- A default project to organize applications

OpenChoreo provides abstractions to define:
- **Organizations** – Manage access and group related projects at cluster scope.
- **Environments** – Set up Dev, Staging, and Prod runtime contexts.
- **DataPlanes** – Define Kubernetes clusters for application deployments.
- **BuildPlanes** – Define dedicated Kubernetes clusters for CI/CD operations.
- **DeploymentPipelines** – Automate application rollouts with promotion workflows.

For more details on these concepts, refer to the [Concepts](../concepts/platform-abstractions.md) documentation.

These default configurations provide a quick starting point. Once you have done some exploration you can start creating the necessary artifacts to match the needs of your organization. You can:

- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-environments">Create new environments</GitHubSampleLink> in your organization
- <GitHubSampleLink path="platform-config/new-deployment-pipeline">Create a new deployment pipeline</GitHubSampleLink> that will link these environments

## Application Deployment
These samples help you deploy different types of applications using OpenChoreo. All samples refer to the default setup.
