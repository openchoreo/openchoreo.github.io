# Quick Start Guide

Follow this guide to quickly set up OpenChoreo in a local environment with Docker.

The setup uses a preconfigured Dev Container that includes all required dependencies for installation and cleanup.

<div className="step-card">
<div className="prereq-header-text">⚙️ Prerequisites</div>

Ensure the following before you begin:

- **Docker** (Engine [26.0+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.0/) recommended)
  - Allocate at least **4 GB RAM** and **2 CPUs**.
- **Mac users:** Use **[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)** for best compatibility

`colima start --vm-type=vz --vz-rosetta --cpu 2 --memory 4`

- **5–10** minutes of setup time

:::note
If you encounter issues with Docker alternatives (Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, etc.), report them via [GitHub](https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/issues).

<div className="step-card">
<div className="step-header">
<div className="step-header-icon">1</div>
<div className="step-header-text">Start the Dev Container</div>
</div>

Run the following command to start the dev container and open a terminal session within it:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
    {String.raw`docker run --rm -it --name openchoreo-quick-start \
--pull always \
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--network bridge \
-p 8443:8443 \
-p 7007:7007 \
ghcr.io/openchoreo/quick-start:`}{versions.dockerTag}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

<div className="step-card">
<div className="step-header">
<div className="step-header-icon">2</div>
<div className="step-header-text">Install OpenChoreo</div>
</div>

Inside the container, run the installation command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`./install.sh --openchoreo-version ${versions.helmChart}`}
</CodeBlock>

This command performs the following:

- Creates a local [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes-in-Docker) cluster
- Installs OpenChoreo and its dependencies using Helm charts.

:::tip
The installation script is idempotent. You can rerun it safely if the process is interrupted.
:::

When installation completes successfully, you see a summary of component statuses:

  src="/img/screenshots/QSG-installation-success.png" 
  alt="Installation Success Screenshot" 
  width="50%" 
/>

:::tip
If any components remain in the `pending` state, wait a few minutes and run the following command to check their status:

```bash
./check-status.sh
```

<div className="step-header-icon">3</div>
<div className="step-header-text">Access the Developer Portal</div>
</div>

The quickstart deployment includes a Backstage instance that acts as the developer portal for managing and visualizing OpenChoreo components. Once the `backstage` component is `[READY]`, access it at:

**🌐 Backstage Portal:** `http://localhost:7007`

The Backstage portal provides:

- **Cell Diagram**: View deployed components and their relationships.
- **Logs**: Access build and runtime logs.
- **Configure and Deploy**: Manage configuration, deployment, and environment promotion

The portal automatically lists all components deployed through OpenChoreo, giving a unified view of the environment.

<div className="step-header-text">Deploy a Sample Web Application</div>
</div>

After setting up OpenChoreo in your Docker environment, deploy a sample web application by running:

```bash
./deploy_web_application.sh
```

When deployment completes, the output includes a message with the application URL:

```text
✅ Endpoint is ready!
🌍 You can now access the Sample Web Application at: https://react-starter-development.choreoapps.localhost:8443
```

### Understanding the Setup

Running the installation and deployment commands initializes OpenChoreo locally and deploys a sample web application.
The following sections describe what occurs behind the scenes.

#### 1. The Install Command

The installation process:

- Initializes a Dev Container with all required tools.
- Creates a KinD (Kubernetes-in-Docker) cluster in Docker.
- Installs the OpenChoreo IDP and dependencies using Helm charts.

#### Foundation Resources Created

The installation automatically provisions the following OpenChoreo abstractions:

- Organization
- Data Plane
- Build Plane
- Environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production)
- Deployment Pipeline
- Project

View these resources using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get organizations
kubectl get dataplanes
kubectl get environments
kubectl get projects
```

View details for a specific resource:

```bash
kubectl get project default -oyaml
```

#### 2. Deploy Command

The deployment script creates:

- A sample Web Application Component
- The corresponding Deployment resource

List deployed components:

```bash
kubectl get components
```

:::tip
Explore more examples in the <Link to={`https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo/tree/${versions.githubRef}/samples`}>Samples</Link> directory or in `/samples` inside the Dev Container.
:::

:::important
When running samples in the Dev Container, you don’t need to expose the OpenChoreo Gateway manually; it’s already available on port 8443 of the host machine.

<div className="step-card">
<div className="step-header">
<div className="step-header-icon">5</div>
<div className="step-header-text">Cleaning up</div>
</div>

After completing your work, choose one of the following options:

1. **Exit and return later**: Exit the Dev Container to resume work later:
   ```bash
    exit
   ```
2. **Full cleanup**: Remove all resources and restore a clean environment:
   ```bash
   ./uninstall.sh
   exit
   ```

This completes the setup and teardown process for OpenChoreo.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Resource Constraints

If installation fails, confirm Docker has sufficient resources:

```bash
docker run --rm alpine:latest sh -c "echo 'Memory:'; free -h; echo; echo 'CPU Cores:'; nproc"
```

Ensure at least **4 GB RAM** and **2 CPU cores** are allocated.

### Port Access Issues (Backstage and External Gateway)

If you're unable to access:

- **Backstage** at `localhost:7007`
- **External Gateway** at port `8443`

Verify that `socat` processes are running inside the Dev Container:

```bash
ps aux | grep socat
```

`socat` handles port forwarding between the container and the host machine. If these processes are not running, re-run the installation command:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
{`./install.sh --openchoreo-version ${versions.helmChart}`}
</CodeBlock>
</div>

You have now set up OpenChoreo locally using a preconfigured environment, deployed a sample web application, and learned how to inspect, manage, and clean up the setup.
This environment serves as a reproducible baseline for testing and evaluating OpenChoreo components and workflows.
